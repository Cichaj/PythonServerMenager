# PythonServerMenager
Server deployment system made with Vultr, FastApi and Py-Cord.
# The way it works:
API made with fastapi provides a virtualmachine in Vultr Cloud. It downloads game server files storaged in Vultr's blockstorage, sets up the server and launches it. All the connection should be made with implemented discord bot.
